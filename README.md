# Shorties Shortcut App

Nice shorties! Quickly copy/paste your fave URLs without going to bookmarks or the browser. 

[Install](https://shorties.caughtmyeye.cc)

Based on [Your First Progressive Web App][codelab] codelab.

## Motivation

We need to share links all the time. This PWA will help save you time if are tired of:

1. Bringing up a browser, typing in a URL, and waiting for the page to load just to copy the link.
2. Brining up a browser, opening up the bookmarks manager, searching for a bookmark and hoping it's in there, then finally copying the link of the bookmark.

## Features

1. Full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) support.
2. Export/import _shorties_ in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. This means you can backup, restore, share, or sync your shortcut links with one file.
3. Search.
4. Lightweight PWA (Progressive Web App).
5. Streamlined interface. E.g. auto saves once input field focus changes.
6. Freely available--no store purchase required.
7. Open source.
